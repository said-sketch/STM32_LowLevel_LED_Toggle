# STM32_LowLevel_LED_Toggle
This project demonstrates low-level (register-level) GPIO control on an STM32 microcontroller. The LED is toggled by directly accessing hardware registers without using HAL or high-level libraries. The goal is to understand memory-mapped I/O, RCC clock control, GPIO configuration, and bitwise operations in bare-metal embedded C.
